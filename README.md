## Description
"Baking, without hassle"

A blog for baking recipes, but ingredient lists get streamlined and converted into a single quantitative measurement of weight. Now you won't have to manually figure out... 
- how many grams are in a cup of butter
- how much sugar you're supposed to add to make 5 servings (instead of say 12 servings)
- how much 50ml of single cream weighs (sure, an extra measuring jug works but why not save some washing up?)

All you'll need is a weighing scale.
